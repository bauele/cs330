## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by reading the requirements, then formulating a plan on how to fulfill all of them.

###  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me learn how to break down complex real world objects into simple shapes.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process was to determine the requirements, break the requirements down into simple steps, then gradually increment my project to eventually incorporate all requirements.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Likewise, I can continue this tactic of requirements analysis and incremental development across all my future projects.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing program by incrementally adding features that align with the provided requirements.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new strategy for this course was to make heavy use of existing examples and documentation to ensure my work was progressing in the right direction by using best practices. 

### How did iteration factor into your development?
I knew I would have to complex the same rendering steps for multiple different ojbects. One I successfully rendered an object with multiple shapes and textures, I knew I would have to iterate and add the same logic for other objects. 

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Every milestone introduced a new requirement to the project. For example, one week was simply combining shapes. Another week was adding a texture. A third week was adding lighting. One I completed a given step for one object, I went back and added the same functionality for additional objects until they were all complete. 

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Since my goal is to be a software developer, computer science can help me by teaching me about the tools and theory involved in the craft.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Though I will not be working with graphics in this capacity during the rest of my career path, the experience of learning how to use documentation for a new technology will certainly help me succeed in future educational settings. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Should I choose to work in any setting that would require using graphics, I now have some experience that can help me on the job.
